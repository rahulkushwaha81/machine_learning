# machine_learning
This repository would contain implementation of different machine algorithms in python. I am starting with linear regression as of now. 

Idea is to have a single repository which would contains all algorithms with different examples. Each example would cover different concepts within that algorithm. 

**Linear regression**

- Simple Linear regression (covered in linear_reg_different_algorithms_housepricing.ipynb)
- Ridge regression  (covered in linear_reg_different_algorithms_housepricing.ipynb)
- Lasso regression  (covered in linear_reg_different_algorithms_housepricing.ipynb)
- Effect of polynomial features on dataset (covered in linear_regression_with_polynomial_features.ipynb)
