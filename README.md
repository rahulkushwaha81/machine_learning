# machine_learning
This repository would contain implementation of different machine algorithms in python. 

Idea is to have a single repository which would contains all algorithms with different examples. Each example would cover different concepts within that algorithm. 

**Linear regression**

- Simple Linear regression
- Ridge regression 
- Lasso regression
- Effect of polynomial features on dataset (covered in linear_regression_with_polynomial_features.ipynb) 

**Classification**

- Logistic regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM
- Artifical Neural Network
